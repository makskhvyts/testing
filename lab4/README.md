3. cargo run steps          # For steps mode
```

## Enhancements and Improvements
- Added randomized tests for different field sizes and piece placements.
- Implemented load tests to check system performance with large datasets.
- Ensured stability and correctness under varying and large input conditions.

## Conclusion

I improved my testing skills by implementing randomized and load tests, ensuring the game's reliability and stability under different conditions and high loads. This approach enhanced code quality and deepened my understanding of software testing.
