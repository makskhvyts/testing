## Full Name and Group

**Full Name:** Khvyts Maksym Serhiyovych  
**Group:** IM-21

## How to use the program?

1. Clone the repository: ``` git clone https://github.com/makskhvyts/testing/tree/main/lab2 ```
2. Install dependencies: ``` npm install ```
3. Run the tests: ``` npm test ```
4. Run the Program: 
```
1. cd js 
2. node index.js input.txt 
```

## Enhancements and Improvements

- Added support for mathematical and statistical functions (`sqrt`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `med`).
- Improved input handling, including error checking for delimiters, multiple operators, and equations.
- History of results with incremental example numbers, stored in `history.txt`.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual function correctness (e.g., operations and large numbers).
- **Integration Tests**: Check module interaction and input/output handling.
- **Load Tests**: Evaluate performance with large data sets.
- **Randomized Tests**: Test program stability with random data scenarios.

## Conclusion

The program's stability, performance, and correctness have been enhanced with improved mathematical functions and error handling. Testing ensured proper module interaction and robustness across various data scenarios.
