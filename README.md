**Group:** IM-21

## Overview

This repository includes the work done for various laboratory assignments in the **Software Quality and Testing** course. The focus of these labs was to understand and implement various testing methodologies, tools, and best practices to ensure the quality of software. The tasks ranged from enhancing test coverage, performing load and randomized tests, and using different testing strategies to improve the stability and performance of programs.

## Labs

1. **[Lab 1 - Game of Life](https://github.com/makskhvyts/testing/tree/main/lab1)**:  
   Focused on implementing Conway's Game of Life simulation with improvements like detecting stable generations, logging steps, and saving the result to a file. Tests were implemented to ensure the program's correctness, stability, and performance under different grid sizes.

2. **[Lab 2 - Calculator](https://github.com/makskhvyts/testing/tree/main/lab2)**:  
   Focused on enhancing mathematical and statistical function handling, adding test coverage, and improving input validation. Also worked on increasing code coverage with unit and integration tests.

3. **[Lab 3 - Tetris](https://github.com/makskhvyts/testing/tree/main/lab3)**:  
   Enhanced test coverage using Tarpaulin for measuring code coverage and generating HTML reports, with a focus on improving the testability of the `io.rs` file.

4. **[Lab 4 - Tetris - Part 2](https://github.com/makskhvyts/testing/tree/main/lab4)**:  
   Implemented randomized and load tests for various game scenarios, ensuring the game's reliability and stability under different conditions and high loads.

## Conclusion

Through these laboratory assignments, I deepened my understanding of software quality and testing. I learned to effectively use testing tools and methodologies to increase test coverage, ensure program stability, and handle various edge cases. The process helped me understand the importance of comprehensive testing in maintaining high-quality software and improving overall development practices.
